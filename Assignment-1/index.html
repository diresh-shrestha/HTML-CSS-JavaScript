                    <h2>Beef</h2>
                    <p>This classic French beef stew, otherwise known as Beef Bourguignon, 
                        is the ultimate comfort food. Chunks of well-marbled beef are seared in olive oil first, 
                        and then gently braised with garlic and onions in a wine-based broth. 
                        After a few hours in the oven, the meat becomes meltingly tender and enveloped in a rich, 
                        deeply flavored sauce.</p>

                    <h2>Sushi</h2>
                    <p>Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, 
                        though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. 
                        It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, 
                        tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. 
                        It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. 
                        Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.</p>
